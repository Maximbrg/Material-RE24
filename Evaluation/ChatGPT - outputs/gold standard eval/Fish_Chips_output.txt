The reasoning behind these associations is based on the user stories provided. The associations represent the interactions between different entities in the system. For example, an order is associated with a customer because a customer makes an order. Similarly, an order is associated with a cashier because a cashier processes the order. The associations that were removed were derived associations, meaning they could be inferred from other associations. For example, the association between a customer and products can be inferred from the association between a customer and orders and the association between orders and products.
