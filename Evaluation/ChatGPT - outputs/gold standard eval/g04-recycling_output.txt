Step 1: Find associations between the classes

1. User - Recycling Facility: Users need to find and interact with recycling facilities, such as viewing their hours and types of waste they accept.
2. User - Waste Type: Users need to select different types of recyclable waste to find suitable recycling facilities.
3. User - Schedule: Users need to manage their schedules for drop-offs at recycling facilities.
4. User - Feedback: Users can provide feedback or complaints about the service.
5. User - Safe Disposal Events: Users need to view safe disposal events in their area.

11. Employees - Questions: Employees may have questions or need to answer questions from users.
12. Employees - Feedback: Employees may need to view or respond to feedback from users.

Step 2: Remove unnecessary/incorrect associations

1. Employees - Questions: This association is not necessary as it's not explicitly mentioned in the user stories that employees need to answer questions from users. This could be a task for admins or customer service representatives.
2. Employees - Schedule: This association is not necessary as it's not explicitly mentioned in the user stories that employees' schedules need to be managed or viewed by users or other system actors.
